To Tenent,Subject: "RENT DUE","That time of the month again, I expect an envelope with proper payment in my mailbox by the end of the week. I don't do 'U-Pay' crap or whatever new scam app you're wasting money on.\n\nDon't think I forgot about last time. You were late, and I let it slide because I'm a nice guy. But kindness doesn't pay my mortgages. So here's the deal: if you don't have my money in 3 days, you're done. Pack your things and find a new hole to crawl into. 400 bucks today, we'll talk about the rest later.",The Landlord,Continue
To Tenent,Subject: "Payment Received","Well, would you look at that. Money actually showed up on time for once. I'll be honest, I wasn't holding my breath.\n\nDon't let it go to your head though. This is how it's supposed to work every month. You pay, you stay. Simple as that. Keep it up and we won't have any problems. See you next month.",The Landlord,Play Again
To Tenent,Subject: "EVICTION NOTICE","That's it. I'm done playing games with you.\n\nI gave you a chance. Hell, I gave you multiple chances. The money isn't here, and my patience ran out three days ago. You've got 24 hours to pack your stuff and get out. Don't bother begging or making excuses. I've heard them all before and frankly, I don't care anymore.\n\nKeys in the mailbox by tomorrow or I'm changing the locks myself. Find somewhere else to mooch.",The Landlord,Retry
