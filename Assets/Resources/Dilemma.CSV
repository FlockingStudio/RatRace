A stranger licks their teeth as they approach you. Smart phone in one hand, microphone in the other. 'Hey hey hey!' they call, 'Welcome to Street Suckers: here's the question.' They throw the microphone like a punch, stopping right in front of your face. 'I've surgically implanted $150 in my gut right here!' They jab at their belly where a small scar lies.

For the first time since you can possibly recall, you take a breath of almost-clean air. Flowers bloom brighter than your screen. Birds sing notes that no computer could replicate.

Against the muddy greys of the city a radiant beacon flickers like a mirage. A thousand neon lights and the familiar beeps and bops of electronic SFX call to you like a siren. Dozens are packed in the arcade. The air hums with static and carries the scent of dust and old soda. Amidst the crowd only one thing is on their lips and it is echoed once more in the flashy poster taped outside. 'Retro Game Tournament: Grand Prize $200.
